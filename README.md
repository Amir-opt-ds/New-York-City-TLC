**Project Overview and Purpose
This is a project from Google Advanced Data Analytics.

We aim to conduct a data analytics project for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency needs to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered.
